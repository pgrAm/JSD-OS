# JSD/OS
A small operating system for 32 bit x86

## What does JSD/OS stand for

The actual meaning of the acronym is intentionally ambigous but might stand for one of "**J**ake **S**. **D**el Mastro **O**perating **S**ystem" or "**J**ake'**S** **D**isk **O**perating **S**ystem" or maybe even "**J**ake'sÂ **S**oftware **D**istribution **O**perating **S**ystem" or finally "**J**ava**S**cript is **D**isallowed **O**perating **S**ystem" 

## Goals

- [x] Run on all almost x86 hardware since the 386sx
- [x] Low Memory footprint < 1MB for a base system
- [x] Highly modular, don't use what you don't need
- [x] Mutitasking using CuFS
- [ ] Zero Screen Tearing by default
- [ ] SMP support
- [ ] AMD64 version

## Non Goals

- POSIX/Unix Compatibility
- Fair scheduling

## Building

requires clang (might work on gcc), nasm, meson, perl, objcopy & xorriso

make sure you initialize your git submodules before building (``git submodule update --recursive --init``)

```
meson setup [build directory] --cross-file mesoncross.ini
meson compile -C [build directory]
```

this will generate an iso file in the build directory you can run on hardware or your favourite emulator

Most linux distros seems to have a pretty old version of meson in their repo, if your distro does not have a version that meets the minimum requirements, a workaround is to install via pip ```pip3 install --user meson```

## FAQ

### What's with "EPSILON" in the release names?

The greek letter Epsilon is often used in mathematics to represent a very small positive value approaching zero, this represents the status of the OS at this point in time, not much, but more than nothing.
